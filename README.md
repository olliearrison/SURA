# SURA

I created this project for my Summer Undergraduate Research Apprenticeship with Nancy Pollard. This application enables users to seamlessly blend 2D and 3D animation techniques. Given a 3D background, the user can select guide points along with the position of the camera at each frame. Using this, the program will set the angle to enable maximum efficiency while drawing. The user can draw 2D line art on the purple transparent canvas, which can be a flat plane, a sphere, or a cylinder, each of which can be moved to any angle in 3D space. Finally, the user can view the final animation, where the camera follows a smooth path while viewing the 2D/3D drawings, reducing the number of frames required to create a convincing animation. This project provided hands-on experience building a unique idea from scratch, encompassing everything from code organization to developing complex algorithms for camera pathing and canvas transformations. I honed my skills in object-oriented programming, data structures, and graphical programming. Moreover, I deepened my knowledge of animation principles and computational geometry, which were crucial in implementing the features of this application. This experience also enhanced my ability to debug complex systems and optimize performance, ensuring a smooth and responsive user experience.
